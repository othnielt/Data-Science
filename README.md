# Data-Science

This project is related to the course CSI4142, where we covered topics such as Big Data,
Analytics, and Cloud Computing. The course focused on various aspects, 
including data preparation, organization, basic statistics, cleaning, 
and integration. Additionally, we explored data mining techniques
such as pattern mining, classification, clustering, outlier and a
nomaly detection. Model evaluation techniques were also discussed.
The course also covered concepts of data warehousing and multi-dimensional analysis.
Lastly, we learned about data visualization and visual data analytics.
